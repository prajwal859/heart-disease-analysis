# Heart Disease Prediction Project Summary

## Data Overview
- Total samples: 10000
- Features: 23 after encoding
- Target distribution: 80% No Heart Disease, 20% Heart Disease (imbalanced)

## Data Processing
- Handled missing values: Filled categorical with mode, numerical with median
- Encoded categorical variables: Binary mapping for Yes/No, ordinal for Low/Medium/High, one-hot for Alcohol Consumption
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler

## Model Performance
We used Logistic Regression with balanced class weights to handle imbalance.
- Test set accuracy: 0.507
- ROC-AUC score: 0.472
- Chosen decision threshold: 0.5

## Limitations
- The model's performance is modest, likely due to weak predictive signals in the dataset and class imbalance.
- Precision for the positive class is low, meaning many false positives.
- Recall is moderate, catching about 42% of actual heart disease cases.

## Future Improvements
- Collect additional features (e.g., family history, genetic markers, detailed lifestyle data)
- Try ensemble methods like XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning
- Use SMOTE for synthetic oversampling
- Gather more data, especially for the minority class
